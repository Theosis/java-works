Electricity Usage Report

An electricity supply authority records on an electricity usage file the amount of electricity that each customer uses.

This file consists of:

a header record (first record), which provides the total kilowatt hours used during the month by all customers
a number of detail records, each containing the customer number, customer name and electricity usage (in kilowatt hours) for the month.
Design a solution algorithm that will read the electricity usage file and produce an electricity usage report showing the customer number, customer name, electricity usage and the amount owing. The amount owing is calculated at 11 cents for each kilowatt hour used, up to 200 hours, and 8 cents for each kilowatt hour used over 200 hours.

The total electricity usage in kilowatt hours is also to be accumulated.

INPUT
  Electricity Usage File:
  -totalKwHr (first record, for verification)
  -custNum, custName, KwHr (1 or more records)

OUTPUT
  Electricity Usage Report:
  -custNum, custName, KwHr, Amt (calculated)
  -sumKwHr (calculated, to compare w/ totalKwHr)

PROCESS
Algorithm

Open the usage file, read and keep the provided totalKwHr,
and for each successive record calculate the $ Amt due:

Amt =   (KwHr * $ 0.11) for 1st 200 KwHr +
      + (KwHr * $ 0.08) for rest.

Also add each customer's KwHr to obtain final sumKwHr.

As each record is processed, print a line of the report
until EOF, then print the supplied and calculated total electricity usage for all customers for the month.
